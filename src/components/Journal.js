        Self Care means to me putting everything I got on pause and loving
        myself for a moment. My go to practices can log me out of my mind and
        ground me when life is life-ing. Journaling, so I have a place to put my
        thoughts, a walk in nature, and forgiving the past through music and
        reflection are some ways I show love to me. Grief and all that comes
        with loss really nudged me to take a deeper look inside and take action,
        to take care.
